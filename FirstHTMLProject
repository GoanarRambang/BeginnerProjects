        <h1>What were your reasons to start coding?</h1>
         <p>
        Since a kid I was always a geek when it came to math and science and loved to play with
        computers and gaming equipment all the time as a child! As time went on, I really dove into
        music production and learn that side of the game and learned those interactions through a 
        computer on my own! Since a child I also had a huge interest into computing and how everything in a computer would work. Since I am a avid learner, I developed interest into cybersecurity, but never took the time to dedicate myself into learning this skill of coding due to life circumstances. Now that I have had the time to free up my time, I am 110% committed into learning and embracing this new skill to change my life forever! :)

        <h1>Favorite Music To Listen To?</h1>
        Man, the list can go on and on all day if I wanted to! Music is my passion on a serious level so I could type for hours about this! :) But I'd rather just give up a few genres that I constantly listen to on a daily basis!
